MinjiDay – A Fan‑Powered Birthday Micro‑Site Tribute

MinjiDay is the ultimate online love letter to Kim Minji, created by Bunnies across the globe to make her birthday an unforgettable celebration. This vibrant, single‑page site combines Y2K aesthetics with modern design sensibilities, immersing every visitor in Minji’s world from the very first scroll. With pastel‑purple accents, dynamic animations, and interactive elements, MinjiDay goes beyond a simple fan page—it’s a community‑driven experience where creativity, admiration, and excitement unite.

From the moment you land on the hero banner, “🎂 Happy Minji Day!” greets you in a bold, playful font set against a soft, dreamy background image of Minji in her element. Below that, a real‑time countdown ticks down to May 7, 2025, building anticipation one second at a time. Whether you’re a longtime Bunny or a newcomer curious about NewJeans’ charismatic leader, this live timer ensures everyone shares the thrill of the approach.

Scrolling further reveals the Fan Gallery, a responsive grid of high‑resolution photos, fanart, and edits submitted by passionate supporters. Each image is captioned with shout‑outs like “Minji’s smile cures all moods” or “Iconic stage moment captured!”—turning the gallery into a visual testament of collective love. Next, the Message Wall invites Bunnies to leave heartfelt wishes, creative drawings, or short video clips via an embedded form. Submissions flow directly into a Google Sheet for easy management, ensuring no message is lost.

To set the mood, an optional background audio loop plays a royalty‑free NewJeans remix—carefully chosen to vibe with Minji’s cool‑girl energy without triggering copyright alerts. And for those who love surprises, a hidden Easter egg waits: hover over the footer logo to unlock a playful pop‑up animation and a secret fan‑made gift link.

Built with clean HTML and CSS, hosted for free on GitHub Pages, and fully mobile‑responsive, MinjiDay is easy to update and share. Dive in, add your creative touch, and help us make Kim Minji’s birthday an international sensation! Let’s light up the web together—because when it comes to celebrating Minji, no detail is too small, and no passion too big.
